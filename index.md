# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about Voltage Stablizers. Voltage stabalizers, as the name suggests help to stabalize or regulate voltage during the times of a voltage drop or an overvoltage. In modern homes one can find a Voltage stabalizer connected to an Air Conditioner or a Refrigerator. It is made up of an Auto Transformer/ Transformer ( step-down ), Electromagnetic relay(s), and electronic circuitry such as OP-AMP and microcontrollers.
